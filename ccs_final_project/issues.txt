a bit late but here is the latest issue and how i solved it


1.Issue with search bar. I found that some places on the bar were not responsive, id click but 
i would'nt be able to type. I had to add flex: 1; to the css for the bar to enable the whole bar. still a bit weird

2. Huge issue, header looked horrible when minimized. claude says it because of the fixed grid columns
2fr auto auto does not resize well, gap 30px is too big. setting the bar to be 800px is way to big (duh)

Fixes: Changed to 1fr auto auto, so the search bar is smaller. Used clamp function so the gaps scale with the viewport
added flex shrink to buttons to get them to not shrink so much (will see how it looks). Adde clamp to width and height to pfp image so its responsive


3. So my issue is that the sidebarr is on top of the header. I know its becuase its fixed but im trying to get it to go underneath the header.
To fix this i added a height to the header. then i used a calc function to measure the height so its directly underneath the header (height: calc(100vh - 80px);)
